DevOps | MLOps | LLMOps | Generative AI | Statistics | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | NLP | Python | JavaScript

I aim to utilize my knowledge and skills in DevOps, MLOps, LLMOps, Machine Learning, Statistics, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, NLP, Python, and JavaScript to contribute to the smooth and efficient functioning of an organization.

Over time, Iâ€™ve realized that satisfaction is a book of achievementsâ€”one that holds records of learning through doing, experimenting, failing, trying again, and ultimately succeeding in a project.
